The R packages car (Fox and Weisberg 2016), ggplot2 (Wickham and Chang 2016), knitr (Xie 2016b), rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2016), and bookdown (Xie 2016a) will need to be installed on the user’s computer. Since bookdown is being actively developed and is not yet on CRAN, you will need to install bookdown from GitHub by typing the following at the R prompt: devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;)  "],
